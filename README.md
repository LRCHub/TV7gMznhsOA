[00:17.36] You keep calling it a crash and burn
[00:19.77] Just wait your turn
[00:21.24] You might have time to speak
[00:23.25] There barely was a lesson learned
[00:25.34] 'Cause in return
[00:26.52] No favors back to me
[00:36.52] 
[00:28.68] I'm sure it tasted, oh, so sweet
[00:31.78] But it was never good enough for me
[00:34.40] I bit the tongue behind my teeth
[00:37.65] It was never good enough for me
[00:53.15] 
[00:40.01] You said you'd always keep your word
[00:43.97] Show me what you're after
[00:45.86] I thought you promised me the world
[00:49.67] Tell me what you're after
[00:51.68] Go on and take it way too far
[00:53.74] 'Cause here we are, waiting once again
[00:57.10] You said you'd always keep your word
[01:00.93] Show me what you're after
[01:02.41] Just a little faster
[01:12.41] 
[01:07.13] Are mine the only eyes that see, so steadily
[01:10.64] This cut and dry routine
[01:13.05] Even when you're by my side
[01:15.04] I still need time to feel the company
[01:33.54] 
[01:18.32] I'm sure it tasted, oh, so sweet
[01:21.46] But it was never good enough for me
[01:24.18] I bit the tongue behind my teeth
[01:27.36] It was never good enough for me
[01:42.86] 
[01:29.89] You said you'd always keep your word
[01:33.67] Show me what you're after
[01:35.55] I thought you promised me the world
[01:39.39] Tell me what you're after
[01:41.34] Go on and take it way too far
[01:43.52] 'Cause here we are, waiting once again
[01:46.82] You said you'd always keep your word
[01:50.68] Show me what you're after
[01:52.07] Just a little faster
[01:57.74] Just a little faster
[02:07.74] 
[02:01.36] Hold your breath now
[02:03.46] The bad blood's wearing thin
[02:05.64] From the pain that settles in
[02:08.41] When we learn too much too soon
[02:12.76] Hold your breath now
[02:14.72] The bad blood's wearing thin
[02:16.98] From the pain that settles in
[02:19.84] When we learn too much too soon (too soon)
[02:40.84] 
[02:25.18] You said you'd always keep your word
[02:29.02] Show me what you're after
[02:30.94] I thought you promised me the world
[02:34.72] Tell me what you're after
[02:36.72] Go on and take it way too far
[02:38.86] 'Cause here we are, waiting once again
[02:57.86] 
[02:42.26] You said you'd always keep your word
[02:46.06] Show me what you're after
[02:51.12] It was never good enough for me
[02:53.97] (It was never good enough for me)
[02:57.33] Show me what you're after
[02:58.90] Just a little faster
